    <h1>Client Report</h1>

    <h2>Client Report</h2>
    <p>For this project I proposed a site called Battleship Adventures. I thought that would be a really hardcore idea and as such tried to make the style of the site match. I sent that to the group. My communication with my lead was great because becuase I was also his lead, so we had plenty to talk about. I think they did a good job making the site look professional and even used gradients, but I wish that they'd given the site more dangerous character. I think next time I do this sort of undertaking I'll have more expirience and just be able to go faster.</p>

    <h2>Lead Developer Report</h2>
    <p>Honestly, communication was pretty difficult for me with regard to my two underlings. I never managed to find them, and had to do both their side pages. The lead was better, as we had a discord together, but I still didn't get great communication with him. I never got a wireframe, and I worked pretty slow, so after doing very little with the home page, he simply went in and made the whole thing how he wanted it. I did get those two side pages done though, and I confirmed that he liked those. I will admit that he was super helpful with Github, because I was very new to it.</p>

    <h2>Junior Developer Report</h2>
    <p>Being a junior developer was pretty difficult. I had more trouble finding these leads, because I wasn't so directly involved with them. They also didn't seem very social or happy to talk to me. For this site though the other Junior was super helpful explaining which page I had to do and how I needed to match my CSS. I did have a bit of trouble with making changes, because Github permissions held me back. Actually, if those aren't approved as of yet my changes might not even be there. I'd also give props to the client, because his channel is real(unfortunately, my site and its advertized service is fake).</p>

    <h2>Junior Developer Report</h2>
    <p>This project was just easier. Even though I still had trouble tracking down my lead, Github was just less picky with all my actions, and I was able to implement my changes easier. For this one I did the workouts page. I just followed the wireframe and the CSS it wasn't too stressful.</p>

    <h2>General Summary</h2>
    <p>The biggest stressor for me was that I lost access to my computer for almost a week. It got me really behind in the project, and to a point where I couldn't remember fist steps while everyone else moved on. I enjoyed that this project has results I can view. Everything I did this semester can be accessed online. If I could do this all over again I would have remembered my computer and done my main page better. Because I didn't really get to flesh out a index page, most of my seen contributions are in 4 different side pages. I do feel more confident than before this project. I know better how to operate Github.</p>
